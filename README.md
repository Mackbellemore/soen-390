# Software Engineering Team Design Project

## Getting started with development

Clone the GitHub repository and create your own branch using the auto-generated ClickUp naming convention.

### Making code changes

Husky is set up at the root of the project.

Husky will run Prettier before every commit (pre-commit hook). This will ensure that we have consistent code style across all developers.

Husky only currently runs in the `client` directory.

### Client

#### Requirements

- Node.js v15+
- Docker v20+

#### Running the project

If you would like to develop inside a Docker container, then you may use the following command `docker-compose up --build`.

If you don't want to use Docker for development (and use your own host environment), then you can simply run `npm install` to install the dependencies, followed by `npm run dev` to start the project for development purposes.

The project will be available at <http://localhost:3000>

As you make changes, the Next.js project will recompile, but you may need to refresh your browser.
